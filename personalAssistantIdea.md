6.  **Reliability:** The memory and database systems must be highly reliable and durable, with robust backup and recovery mechanisms to prevent data loss.
7.  **Extensibility:** The system should be designed in a modular way to easily allow for the future addition of new tools, AI models, avatars, and functionalities.
8.  **Consistency:** The AI's personality and user experience must be consistent across all platforms (web, mobile, WhatsApp).

### 1. Choice of Models

*   **Core Language Model (LLM):** The heart of your AI companion will be a powerful, conversational, and multimodal LLM.
    *   **Model Type:** A state-of-the-art large language model with strong instruction-following, conversational abilities, and emotional intelligence. Multimodality is key for understanding user sentiment and tone.
    *   **Training Data:** The model should be fine-tuned on a diverse dataset of conversations, literature, and texts related to psychology, coaching, and personal development. This will help the AI to be a more effective companion.
    *   **Example Models:** Google's Gemini family of models or OpenAI's GPT-4o would be excellent choices due to their advanced reasoning, multimodality, and long context windows.

*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) Models:**
    *   **Model Type:**
        *   **TTS:** A model capable of generating natural-sounding speech in a variety of voices and emotional tones.
        *   **STT:** A highly accurate real-time speech-to-text transcription model.
    *   **Training Data:**
        *   **TTS:** Trained on a large dataset of human speech from a diverse range of speakers to capture different vocal styles and emotions.
        *   **STT:** Trained on a massive dataset of transcribed audio from various accents and in different environments to ensure robustness.
    *   **Example Models:** Google's Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text APIs, or services like ElevenLabs for realistic voice generation.

*   **Avatar/Face Generation Model:**
    *   **Model Type:** A generative model like a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create and animate realistic human-like avatars.
    *   **Training Data:** Trained on a vast dataset of human faces, expressions, and animations.
    *   **Example Models:** Unreal Engine's MetaHuman Creator or a custom-trained StyleGAN.

### 2. Memory Strategies

*   **Short-Term Memory:**
    *   **Implementation:** An in-memory database like **Redis** or **Memcached**.
    *   **Function:** This will store the recent conversation history (e.g., the last 10-20 turns of conversation). This allows the AI to maintain context within a single conversational session. The data can be stored as key-value pairs, with the user ID as the key and a list of conversation turns as the value.

*   **Long-Term Memory & RAG:**
    *   **Implementation:** A combination of a vector database and a document-oriented database.
        *   **Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus, ChromaDB):** This will store embeddings of user conversations and significant life events. This enables semantic search over the user's memories, allowing the AI to retrieve relevant information even if the user doesn't use the exact same phrasing.
        *   **Document-Oriented Database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL with JSONB):** This will store structured and semi-structured data about the user, such as their profile, preferences, calendar events, and the raw text of conversations.
    *   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
        1.  When a user interacts with the AI, the system will first query the vector database to retrieve relevant memories.
        2.  These memories are then passed to the LLM as context, along with the user's current query.
        3.  This provides the AI with a "memory" that extends beyond the current conversation, leading to more personalized and insightful interactions.

### 3. System Design Components

*   **API Gateway:** A single entry point for all client requests (web and mobile). It will route requests to the appropriate microservices. **Kong**, or a cloud-native solution like **Amazon API Gateway** or **Google Cloud API Gateway** would be a good choice.
*   **Cache:**
    *   **In-memory cache (Redis):** For short-term memory and caching frequently accessed data like user profiles.
*   **Databases:**
    *   **MongoDB or PostgreSQL:** As the primary database for storing user data, conversation logs, and other application data.
    *   **Vector Database (Pinecone, Milvus):** For long-term memory and RAG.
*   **Model Deployment:**
    *   **Serverless Functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions):** For deploying the TTS and STT models, as they are well-suited for short, stateless tasks.
    *   **Kubernetes:** For deploying the core LLM and other stateful services. This will allow for easy scaling and management of the models.
*   **Message Broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka):** To handle asynchronous communication between microservices, especially for tasks like processing memories, sending notifications, and interacting with external APIs (like WhatsApp).

### 4. Microservice Architecture

Here is a potential microservice architecture for your application:

*   **User Service:** Manages user authentication, profiles, and preferences.
*   **Conversation Service:** Handles the core conversational logic, interacting with the LLM, TTS, and STT models.
*   **Memory Service:** Manages the long-term and short-term memory of the AI, including the RAG pipeline.
*   **Notification Service:** Sends proactive messages to the user via WhatsApp or other channels.
*   **Calendar Service:** Integrates with the user's calendar to provide personal assistant features.
*   **Tool Service:** Manages the extensible toolset for the AI.
*   **Avatar Service:** Interacts with the avatar generation system.
